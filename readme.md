# FitHappens

I developed the FitHappens app with a desire to teach myself iOS and have a grasp of some basic mobile concepts.

The app offers a list of fitness events around the UK, all stored in Firebase. The list can be filtered by cities 
and more information can be obtained by selecting an event (location, website, price and date). 
Navigation is also offered with apple maps.
